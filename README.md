# Bug-Bounty-Hunting
Year 2 Semester 2 Individual Project.
A vulnerability rewards program (VRP), also known as a bug bounty program, is a crowdsourcing initiative where individuals are rewarded for discovering and reporting software vulnerabilities. These programs are often implemented as part of a company's vulnerability management strategy, complementing internal code audits and penetration testing efforts. Bug bounty programs incentivize white hat hackers and security researchers by offering financial rewards for identifying and disclosing software flaws that could be exploited.

Bug reports submitted to these programs must contain sufficient information for the company to replicate the vulnerability. The amount of payment varies depending on factors such as the company's size, the complexity of exploiting the system, and the potential impact of the discovered vulnerability on consumers. Companies like Mozilla, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Apple have all offered bug bounty programs with varying reward amounts.

While bug bounty programs can be an effective way to identify and address software vulnerabilities, opinions about them are mixed. Some companies opt for invitation-only or closed bug bounty programs to minimize potential risks. For example, Apple has limited bug reward participation to a select group of researchers.
